# Secret scanning of the commits CI is asked about (#206). Run by Static in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml and weekly by .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml;
# tested by secret-scan.test.sh.
#
#   secret-scan.sh install   the pinned gitleaks binary, checksum verified
#   secret-scan.sh range     print the `git log` range this event covers
#   secret-scan.sh scan      run gitleaks over that range
#
# WHICH COMMITS
#
#   pull request   base..head: every commit the branch adds, intermediate ones
#                  included. A secret committed and then deleted two commits
#                  later is still in the history the merge would publish.
#   push to main   before..after: the commits that push added. A force push or
#                  a new branch (no usable `before`) scans after's whole history.
#   MODE=full      every ref in the clone: the weekly full-history scan.
#   anything else  (a tag, a manual run) nothing new: a tag names a commit main
#                  already scanned. Said so, not silently skipped.
#
# Findings are printed REDACTED (`--redact`): the file, line, commit and rule,
# never the value. No report file is written or uploaded. A finding exits 3;
# any other failure is gitleaks itself failing, which is not "no secrets".
#
# Inputs are environment variables: EVENT_NAME, REF, BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA,
# BEFORE, AFTER, MODE. gitleaks and git are called by name.
